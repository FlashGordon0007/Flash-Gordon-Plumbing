      <p>With over 30 years of experience in the Plumbing trade the owner Gordon Montgomery has been Plumbing since
        1993.
        He served many years of his 6 year apprenticeship in the San Juan Islands working for a master of Hydronic and
        Radiant In-Floor Heating Systems. He received his Journeyman Plumbers license in 2001. He formed a partnetship
        with an electrician and they specialized in new construction complete mechanical packages providing all the
        plumbing, heating, and electrical needs for each home. He has been fabricating sheet metal since 2006
        and designs In
        Floor
        Heating systems that use the most advanced technology in the world known as Outdoor Reset with variable speed
        injection mixing. Using these skills He invented a Smart Hot Water Furnace System in 2018 and took it to the
        Lynden Home Show. Since 2018 he has sold dozens these amazing Furnaces that use a tankless water heater to
        provide
        endless hot water for up to 3 showers at once and heat the home with a radiant heat. Gordon's Hot Water Furnace
        is
        the most efficient furnace on the planet! It uses a smart variable speed pump to circulate hot water through a
        stainless steel radiator inside the furnace cabinet; and a smart variable speed High performance fan. The fan
        has
        a soft start so it is silent when it starts, and then every 6 minutes it speeds up it's output by 10%. Once the
        smart thermostate is satisfied the furnace reverses the proces and starts to reduce it's output by 10% every 6
        minutes. The result is a furnace that finds the sweet spot of maintaining the homes desired temperature at the
        lowest possible speed. The smart thermostate can be operated by any smart phone from anywhere in the world. The
        free app by Google that comes with the Nest thermostate provides all of the homes energy usage data. These
        systems
        typically save the customer 85% in energy costs comparred to their old traditional heating system. The furnace
        has
        no burner to leak like traditional furnaces that can cause death by leaking poisionous carbon monoxide gases
        into
        the home. This makes these furnaces the safest in the world and their is virtually no mainenance!. They come
        with
        a lifetime warranty and only require the filter to be changed saving you thousands in costly maintenance bills.
